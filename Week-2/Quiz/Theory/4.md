<b>Question:</b>
```
Suppose we had reason to suspect that this neuron responded to two modes (features) of the stimulus. 
Which of the following methods is most likely to help us determine those two modes?

(i) Principal component analysis/covariance analysis
(ii) Dividing the spikes into two disjoint sets and computing the spike-triggered average for each of those sets independently.
(iii) Computing the spike-triggered average to get the first mode and then subtracting it from the stimulus in each time window before a spike and then computing the spike-triggered average for the resulting signal to get the second mode.
(iv) Computing the spike-triggered average normally.
```
