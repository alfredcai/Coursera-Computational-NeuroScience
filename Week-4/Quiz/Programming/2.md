<b>Question:</b>
```
Finally, we ran an additional set of experiments in which we exposed each of the neurons to a single stimulus of unknown direction for 10 trials of 10 seconds each. 
We have placed the results of this experiment in pop_coding.mat, 
```
which you may download <a href="https://spark-public.s3.amazonaws.com/compneuro/code/quiz3/pop_coding.mat">here</a>. 
```
You should save the file into your MATLAB/Octave directory and import the data using the following command: 
```
```
load('pop_coding.mat')
```
```
The equivalent python files are: 
```
<a href="https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/compneuro/code/quiz3/python/2.7/pop_coding.pickle">pop_coding.pickle</a> (Python 2.7) and <a href="https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/compneuro/code/quiz3/python/3.4/pop_coding.pickle">pop_coding.pickle</a> (Python 3.4),
``` 
and can be loaded in the same way as 'tuning.pickle' was loaded in question 11. 
```
```
pop_coding contains four vectors named r1, r2, r3, and r4 that contain the responses 
(firing rate in Hz) of the four neurons to this mystery stimulus. 

It also contains four vectors named c1, c2, c3, and c4. 
These are the basis vectors corresponding to neuron 1, neuron 2, neuron 3, and neuron 4. 

Decode the neural responses and recover the mystery stimulus vector by computing the population vector for these neurons. 
You should use the maximum average firing rate (over any of the stimulus values in 'tuning.mat') for a neuron as the value of rmax for that neuron. 
That is, rmax should be the maximum value in the tuning curve for that neuron. 

What is the direction, in degrees, of the population vector? 
You should round your answer to the nearest degree. 
Your answer should contain the value only (no units!) and should be between 0 degree and 360 degree. 
If your calculations give a negative number or a number greater than or equal to 360, convert it to a number in the proper range 
(you may use the mod function to do this). 

You may need to convert your resulting vector from Cartesian coordinates to polar coordinates to find the angle. 
You may use the atan() function in MATLAB to do this. 

Note that the convention we're using defines 0 degree to point in the direction of the positive y-axis and 90 degree to point in the direction of the positive x-axis 
(i.e., 0 degrees is north, 90 degrees is east).
