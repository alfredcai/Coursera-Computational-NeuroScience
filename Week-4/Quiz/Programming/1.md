<b>Question:</b>
```
In the following three questions, 
we will explore Poisson neuron models and population coding. 

This exercise is based on a set of artificial "experiments" that we've run on four simulated neurons that emulate the behavior found in the cercal organs of a cricket. 
Please note that all the supplied data is synthetic. 
Any resemblance to a real cricket is purely coincidental. 

In the first set of experiments, we probed each neuron with a range of air velocity stimuli of uniform intensity and differing direction. 
We recorded the firing rate of each of the neurons in response to each of the stimulus values.
 Each of these recordings lasted 10 seconds and we repeated this process 100 times for each neuron-stimulus combination. 

We've supplied you with a file containing data for each of the neurons that contains the recorded firing rates (in Hz). 
These are named neuron1, neuron2, neuron3, and neuron4. 
The stimulus, that is, the direction of the air velocity, is in the vector named stim. 
```
Download the file <a href="https://spark-public.s3.amazonaws.com/compneuro/code/quiz3/tuning.mat">here</a>, and save it into your MATLAB/Octave directory. 
```
To load the data, use the following command:
```
```
load('tuning.mat')
```
```
The equivalent data files for Python 2.7 and Python 3.4 are: 
```
<a href="https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/compneuro/code/quiz3/python/2.7/tuning.pickle">tuning.pickle</a> (Python 2.7) or <a href="https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/compneuro/code/quiz3/python/3.4/tuning.pickle">tuning.pickle</a> (Python 3.4). 
```
To load the data in tuning.pickle, make sure you are in the same directory you saved it and add the following to your script:
```
```
import pickle
with open('tuning.pickle', 'rb') as f:
    data = pickle.load(f)
```
```
This will load everything into a dict called data, 
and you'll be able to access the stim and neuron responses using data['stim'], data['neuron1'], etc. 
(In general, data.keys() will show you all the keys available in the dict.) 
```
```
The matrices contain the results of running a set of experiments in which we probed the synthetic neuron with the stimuli in stim. 
Each column of a neuron matrix contains the firing rate of that neuron (in Hz) in response to the corresponding stimulus value in stim. 
That is, the nth column of neuron1 contains the 100 trials in which we applied the stimulus of value stim(n) to neuron1. 
```
```
Plot for each of the neurons:
the tuning curve,
the mean firing rate of the neuron as a function of the stimulus. 
```
```
Which of the following functions best describes the tuning curve?

(i) Linear function.
(ii) Gaussian.
(iii) Unrectified cosine.
(iv) Half-wave rectified cosine.
