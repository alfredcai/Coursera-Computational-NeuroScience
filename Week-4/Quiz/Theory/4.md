```
Why do we see a difference between the two criteria, if there is one?

(i) Since ML assumes a Gaussian distribution, unlike MAP, it oversimplifies the world.
(ii) The role of the prior probability is different between the two.
(iii) Unlike MAP, ML assumes the same model for all people.
(iv) There is no difference between the two, because in this case they are equivalent.
