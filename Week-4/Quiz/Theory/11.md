<b>Question:</b>
```
We have reason to suspect that one of the neurons is not like the others. 
Three of the neurons are Poisson neurons 
(they are accurately modeling using a Poisson process), 
but we believe that the remaining one might not be. 
Which of the neurons (if any) is NOT Poisson? 
```
```
Hint: 
Think carefully about what it means for a neuron to be Poisson. 
You may find it useful to review the last lecture of week 2. 
Note that we give you the firing rate of each of the neurons, not the spike count. 
You may find it useful to convert the firing rates to spike counts in order to test for "Poisson-ness", 
however this is not necessary. 

In order to realize why this might be helpful, 
consider the fact that, for a constant a and a random variable X, 
E[aX]=aE[X] but Var(aX)=a2Var(X). 
What might this imply about the Poisson statistics 
(like the Fano factor) 
when we convert the spike counts (the raw output of the Poisson spike generator) into a firing rate 
(what we gave you)?

(i) Neuron 2.

(iv) None.
(v) Neuron 1.
