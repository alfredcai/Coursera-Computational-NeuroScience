<b>Question:</b>
```
Suppose we are diagnosing a very rare illness, 
which happens only once in 100 million people on average. 

Luckily, we have a test for this illness but it is not perfectly accurate. 

If somebody has the disease, it will report positive 99% of the time. 
If somebody does not have the disease, it will report positive 2% of the time.

Suppose a patient walks in and tests positive for the disease. 

Using the maximum likelihood (ML) criterion, would we diagnose them positive?

(i) Yes
(ii) No
